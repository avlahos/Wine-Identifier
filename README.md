For those times when you're missing your drinking buddy, Wine Identifier makes the perfect substitute -- quite the wine connoisseur. This program uses an LSTM model to train on descriptions of wine in order to accurately identify the type of wine the user may be drinking.

### Data
The data has been pulled from Kaggle and is available in this GitHub repository for download.

### Dependencies
This program uses the following libraries:
numpy -> scientific and mathematical computing with Python
pandas -> data structures and data analysis
sklearn -> used for preprocessing
nltk -> used for dictionaries and tokenizers
keras -> wrapper for Tensorflow that allows us to write neural networks

### How to run
Clone this project to your computer, cd into the directory, and run "jupyter notebook" in the terminal. Proceed to click the ipybn to run it.
